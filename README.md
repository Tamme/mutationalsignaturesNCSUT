# mutationalsignaturesNCSUT

Codes and snippets of different methods used for deciphering mutational signatures from human cancer genomes.

These are mainly meant for self modification to suit users needs. A lot of input file names and dimensions have to be specified. Thse are mainly scripts to guide the user.

All methods except neural network, needs features to be the first dimension for the data matrix and samples for the second one.

Matlab based codes were tested and working with version R2013a.
Python version 2.7 was used
